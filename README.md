> Pandemic burden in low-income settings and impact of limited
and delayed interventions: a granular modelling analysis of COVID-19 in Kabwe, Zambia

This is an [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) project. The directories are:

* `src`: create new reports here
* `global`: R scripts with some basic functions used across reports
* `draft`: versioned results of running your report
* `archive`: committed reports from draft

## Running the analysis

A sequence of tasks needs to be run to infer (fit) the model parameters to reproduce all results and plots in the manuscript. This is sketched out in the [`run.R`](run.R) script, though this is provided only as a form of documentation.

For the publication manuscript, the fitting tasks were run over several days on a HPC. However, shorter MCMC and pMCMC chains can be run on a local computer as follows:

1. Run the `ZamCovid_kabwe_data` task to prepare the data for fitting.
2. Run the `ZamCovid_kabwe_parameters` task.
3. Run the `ZamCovid_kabwe_fits` task for each of the central or sensitivity analysis scenarios.
4. Run the `ZamCovid_kabwe_sens_analysis` task.
5. Run the `ZamCovid_kabwe_simulation` task.

Note the `ZamCovid_kabwe_sens_analysis` task will require a matching set of parameters (2) and fitting (3) tasks with all of central and other assumptions used for sensitivity analysis, as specified in `run.R`. Also note that tasks 2 and 3 can be run either with the deterministic equivalent or the full stochastic model. The `ZamCovid_kabwe_simulation` task requires the fitted stochastic model to run.

## Requirements

The core requirement is our [sircovid](https://mrc-ide.github.io/ZamCovid/) package and its dependencies. Please ensure you install the versions we used for preparation of the manuscript:

```r
remotes::install_github(c(
  "mrc-ide/dust@v0.15.1",
  "mrc-ide/mcstate@v0.9.20",
  "mrc-ide/ZamCovid@v0.1.3"))
```

You will also need a recent [orderly](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/orderly/) which can be installed with

```r
drat:::add("vimc")
install.packages("orderly")
```
